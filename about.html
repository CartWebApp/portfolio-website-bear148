        <div class="section image-text">
            <p>I’m a 16-year-old high school student at Clovis West in Fresno, California. Over the past few years, I’ve developed a real passion for coding and web development. I love solving problems, building cool things from scratch, and constantly pushing myself to learn something new. This website is a glimpse into that journey containing a collection of some of the projects I have created, each one representing a step in my growth as a developer. Whether it’s a game, a tool, or a full-on website, I have had a blast bringing each project to life. I am excited to share my work with you, and I hope you enjoy exploring it as much as I enjoyed building it!</p>

            <div class="project">
                <h3>Trion Supercars</h3>
                <p>A sleek, high-end website for a fictional supercar company. This project was  about balancing eye-catching design with smooth functionality — and I had a great time experimenting with web design.</p>

            <div class="project">
                <h3>Tank Clicker</h3>
                <p>A simple and intuitive to-do list application that helps users manage their tasks efficiently. It features task creation, editing, and deletion, and is built using JavaScript and local storage for data persistence.</p>

            <div class="project">
                <h3>EECU Budget Calculator</h3>
                <p>A practical tool that helps users calculate taxes and manage a digital checkbook based on different career choices. It’s all about usability and clean design.</p>

            <div class="project">
                <h3>MD5 Reverse Hasher</h3>
                <p>A tool I built to help users solve word-guessing puzzles by using reverse hashing techniques. It really stretched my skills in programming, algorithms, and logic. Each project taught me something new, whether it was a technical challenge or a creative one.</p>

            <h2>Post-Secondary School Plan</h2>
            <p>After high school, I plan to attend California State University, Fresno (also known as Fresno State University) and major in Electrical Engineering. I have always been curious about how things work, from small gadgets to massive systems, and I’m especially interested in areas like robotics and automation. My goal is to combine hands-on experience with real-world applications, and I’m excited to see where this path takes me.</p>
