            <p>So far, the newest Diablo 4 season has brought about many changes that have had huge impacts on the meta. One of the changes with the biggest impact is the addition of the Fractured Winterglass. This unique is huge for lightning spear because it reduces all of your skill cooldowns every time a Frozen Orb. With my Lightning Spear build, this is taken advantage of with Attack Speed from my gear. With Attack Speed the Chance for Frozen Orb Projectiles to Cast Twice on the Fractured Winterglass, cooldown reduction can take place meaning you can spam Lightning Spear. There is more that goes into the build than just the Fractured Winterglass.</p>

            <h2>Pros and Cons of Lightning Spear</h2>
            <h3>Pros:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Extremely powerful throughout all points in the game.</li>
                <li>Easy to play.</li>
                <li>Can solo most content past a certain point.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Cons:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Very gear dependant.</li>
                <li>Not good for single targets.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Gearing</h2>
            <p>The gearing process of the Lightning Spear Sorcerer was pretty smooth for me at least. Early on, with the help of some friends, I was able to get some pretty decent gear that would allow me to solo most of the content I would need to grind for gear. When gearing a Lightning Gear sorcerer on your own, not only is it difficult to gear because it requires lots of specific affixes, but reforging is incredibly important as well. Reforging can be a huge pain, and I definitely experienced it when gearing my sorcerer. Critical Damage is a huge part of this build as well and is usually always reforged on items that allow for Offensive reforges. By the end of the min-maxing process, your character should have a total of ~2000% Critical Strike Damage. This is the threshold where the build becomes incredibly good. Even before the ~2000% Critical Strike Damage, with the right amount of Attack Speed, Cooldown Reduction can be incredibly powerful.</p>

            <p>An important thing to note when gearing a Lightning Spear Sorcerer is that the build benefits hugely from the Harlequin's Crest. This piece of gear offers huge cooldown reduction and you can get even more than the default if you are lucky enough to get one with a GA (Greater Affix). If you hit all of your masterworks into Cooldown Reduction on a GA'd Harlequin's Crest, it can offer a whopping 54.0% Cooldown Reduction. With all of the correct gear, your Lightning Spear should be down to roughly 5 to 6 seconds.</p>

            <h2>What this has done to the game's economy</h2>
            <p>Right now, trading for any of these items used by the Lightning Spear build is practically impossible unless you want to overpay. I was lucky enough to get a Fractured Winterglass with 3 Greater Affixes! This item would normally be worth roughly 50b coins, but with the Lightning Spear, you can really only find these amulets with 3 Greater Affixes going for around 300b coins. Although the Fractured Winterglass is an integral piece of the build, it still shouldn't be as much as it is right now. You can expect this same effect for the other pieces of gear the build relies on as well. If the Harlequin's Crest wasn't account bound on pickup, you could only imagine how much that piece of armor would go for knowing it is an integral part of many other builds, not just Lightning Spear.</p>
