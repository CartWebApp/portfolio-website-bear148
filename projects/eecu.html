            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>The credit union EECU tasked us with creating a functioning budget calculator that allowed users to input a job and figure out their tax information based on that jobâ€™s yearly salary. I was a project manager for my own project and a developer for others. As a developer, the majority of my time was spent restructuring HTML. As a project manager, I focused on teamwork, efficiency, and getting everything working smoothly. My personal version of the project turned out exactly the way I designed. My budget calculator allows the user to select a job, and once they have selected that job, every piece of information regarding taxes, monthly income, net monthly income, mortgage payment, etc will be automatically populated as soon as the user selects their job. The user can also use a fully featured checkbook that updates the user's balance whether the check is a withdrawal or a deposit. The user can also give these checks names or descriptions to better understand their finances.</p>
