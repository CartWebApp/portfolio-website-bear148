            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>This MD5 reverse hasher was created when my friend and I found the a request which contained a response that had every single solution for a word puzzle game we were playing. When we found this, we wanted to see if we could use it to instantly solve each puzzle we played without having to analyze the whole puzzle and figure out the words analyitcally. We tried a bunch of different things until we settled on this MD5 reverse hasher. The way it works is actually pretty simple, we took every possible English word, converted it to its corresponding MD5 hash, and then we use the list of all MD5 hashes and compare each MD5 hash found in the game's board packet to the ones in our list, and if we have a match, we input that word into the input box.</p>
