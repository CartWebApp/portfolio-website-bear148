            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>This is a simple website that isn't exactly functional in the sense it is actually used, but a user is able to fully navigate the pages and look through as if it were real. But as of right now, it doesn't actual function it is more of a proof of concept. This webstie was made as a projcet where we were tasked with creating a website for the upcoming supercar company Trion Supercars. We had to follow a user flow and a minimal viable product to create our website. The user flow we picked to create was the user changing the stitching color in the interior of their car.</p>
